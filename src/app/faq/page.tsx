        {
          question: 'How do I prevent my pipes from freezing during Kamloops winters?',
          answer: 'Kamloops winters can reach -30¬∞C, so pipe protection is crucial. Keep your home heated to at least 15¬∞C, insulate pipes in crawl spaces and basements, let faucets drip during extreme cold snaps, and seal any air leaks near plumbing. We offer winterization services for seasonal properties.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I do if my pipes freeze in my Kamloops home?',
          answer: 'Turn off your main water supply immediately, open faucets to relieve pressure, and never use open flames to thaw pipes. Call us at (250) 828-8761 - we have specialized thawing equipment and can safely restore your water flow without damaging pipes.'

      faqs: [
        {
          question: 'Is Kamloops tap water safe to drink?',
          answer: 'Yes, Kamloops municipal water meets all Health Canada standards. However, some residents prefer additional filtration due to mineral content and taste preferences. We install whole-house filtration systems, UV sterilizers, and water softeners tailored to local water conditions.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Why does my water taste different in Kamloops compared to other cities?',
          answer: 'Kamloops water comes from the Thompson River and underground sources, giving it a unique mineral profile. The taste can vary seasonally due to source changes and treatment processes. We can test your water and recommend appropriate filtration if desired.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do I need a water softener in Kamloops?',
          answer: 'Kamloops has moderately hard water (150-300 ppm), which can cause scale buildup in appliances and plumbing. A water softener can extend appliance life, reduce soap usage, and improve water feel. We offer free water testing to determine if softening would benefit your home.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How often should I replace my water heater in the Kamloops climate?',
          answer: 'In Kamloops\' climate, tank water heaters typically last 8-12 years due to mineral content and temperature variations. Tankless units can last 15-20 years with proper maintenance. We recommend annual inspections to maximize lifespan and efficiency.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What size water heater do I need for my Kamloops home?',
          answer: 'For Kamloops homes: 40-50 gallons for 1-2 people, 50-60 gallons for 3-4 people, and 60-80 gallons for larger families. Tankless units are sized by flow rate (GPM). We consider your home size, usage patterns, and local water temperature in our recommendations.'

      faqs: [
        {
          question: 'What type of heating system works best in Kamloops\' climate?',
          answer: 'For Kamloops\' semi-arid climate with cold winters, we recommend high-efficiency gas furnaces, heat pumps (for newer homes), or combination systems. Natural gas is readily available and cost-effective. We can assess your home and recommend the most efficient option.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How often should I service my furnace in Kamloops?',
          answer: 'We recommend annual furnace maintenance before each heating season (typically September/October). Kamloops\' dusty conditions and temperature swings require regular filter changes every 1-3 months and professional cleaning to maintain efficiency and safety.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do heat pumps work effectively in Kamloops winters?',
          answer: 'Modern cold-climate heat pumps work well in Kamloops, maintaining efficiency down to -25¬∞C. However, backup heating is recommended for extreme cold snaps. We install and service both air-source and ground-source heat pump systems.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Why is my heating bill so high in Kamloops?',
          answer: 'High heating bills in Kamloops often result from poor insulation, air leaks, inefficient equipment, or thermostat issues. Kamloops\' wide temperature swings stress heating systems. We offer energy audits and can recommend upgrades to reduce costs.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What rebates are available for heating upgrades in BC?',
          answer: 'BC and federal rebates include up to $5,000 for heat pumps, up to $1,000 for high-efficiency furnaces, and additional incentives for insulation and smart thermostats. We help navigate available programs and ensure you get maximum rebates.'

        },
        {
          question: 'How do I know if I have a gas leak in my Kamloops home?',
          answer: 'Signs include: rotten egg smell, hissing sounds near gas appliances, dead vegetation near gas lines, or dirt blowing from underground. If you suspect a leak, leave immediately, don\'t use electrical switches, and call FortisBC gas emergency line: 1-800-663-9911, then call us for repairs.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can you install a gas line for my BBQ or fire pit in Kamloops?',
          answer: 'Yes! We install gas lines for BBQs, fire pits, outdoor heaters, and other appliances throughout Kamloops. All installations meet BC safety codes and include proper permits and inspections through Technical Safety BC.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How often should gas appliances be inspected in Kamloops?',
          answer: 'We recommend annual inspections for gas furnaces, water heaters, and fireplaces. Kamloops\' temperature extremes and dusty conditions can affect gas appliance performance and safety. Regular maintenance prevents costly repairs and ensures safe operation.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do you service gas fireplaces and inserts in Kamloops?',
          answer: 'Absolutely! We service, repair, and install gas fireplaces, inserts, and direct-vent units throughout Kamloops. We handle everything from routine maintenance to complete installations, including venting and gas line connections.'
